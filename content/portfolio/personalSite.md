### The Story
Throughout my life I had been interested in technology, though I had always felt as if something was missing.. While I could hold my own during CS[^CS] classes and exercises, when it came down to actual software development, I had never quite gotten the hang of things, especially when it came to web development.

So, while I'm not inclined on changing professions anytime soon, I still aspire to learn more of the tech behind the products, this being one of my first steps towards software development.

### The Work
This static was developed with <img src="/portfolio/img/hugo.png" alt="Hugo" style="width: 20px;"/> [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed to <img src="/portfolio/img/github.png" alt="Hugo" style="width: 30px;"/>[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), it's managed completely via [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files, and was created at $0 costs. Full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Yuvaldv/mySite-Hugo).
