### The Story
Throughout my life I had been interested in technology, though I always felt as if something was missing.. I could hold my own during CS classes and exercises, but when it came down to creating something new i.e software development, I had never quite gotten the hang of things, I was just a coder, not a developer.

So, while I'm not inclined on changing professions anytime soon, I don't like being dependent on finding a developer for side-projects either. Thus this is one of my first steps towards software development.


### The Work
This is a static website composed of [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files, developed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
