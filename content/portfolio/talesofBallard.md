[<i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Rachel Ballard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-ballard-9957224/) is a talented product manager working on professional CGI tools at [Foundry](https://www.foundry.com/)

She had asked me to start working on a product management blog she was conceptualizing at the time. Overall i had  [written](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok9RhZibGKr2RL-fR8AEm31jsIPqSHW05nS7fDG3GG8/pub) just about 2000 words as well as a skeletal structure for 7 more posts and a suggested brand identity.

Around the same time I had been approached by yet another speculative investments company impressed with the content I had written for [Glenmore Capital](/portfolio/portfolio/blackrockmarketing/) they asked me to write their own.

I started by [writing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHsH99Abg5cKAxp8yjC_-SgZEjj2_o5VAlme5AWzvFw/pub) the company homepage, inner pages and then moved on to the company blog using notes from the company's financial analyst, Daniel.
