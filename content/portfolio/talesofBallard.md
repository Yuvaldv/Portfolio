### Tales of Ballard - A Product Management Story
[<img src="/portfolio/img/tob.png" alt="ToB" style="width: 250px;"/>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok9RhZibGKr2RL-fR8AEm31jsIPqSHW05nS7fDG3GG8/pub)
#### The Story
One pastoral April evening as I was sitting at a local bar waiting my turn for the open-mic, I suddenly get a notification from [<img src="/portfolio/img/upwork.png" alt="upwork" style="width: 20px;"/>Upwork](upwork.com), apparently I was being invited to bid on a copywriting project for a product management blog created by the gifted [<i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Rachel Ballard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-ballard-9957224/).

#### The Work
Overall i've [written](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ok9RhZibGKr2RL-fR8AEm31jsIPqSHW05nS7fDG3GG8/pub) just about 2000 words as well as a skeletal structure for 7 more posts and a suggested brand identity, unfortunately we had to part ways due to deployment issues.

### Trade Financial

#### The Story
Around the same time I had been approached by yet another speculative investments company impressed with the content I had written for [Glenmore Capital](/portfolio/portfolio/blackrockmarketing/) they asked me to write their own.

#### The Work
I started by [writing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHsH99Abg5cKAxp8yjC_-SgZEjj2_o5VAlme5AWzvFw/pub) the company homepage and inner pages and then moved on to the company blog written using notes from the company analyst Daniel Gartner. With that we were all done.
