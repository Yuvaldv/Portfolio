### The Story
One dreary October evening during an unfortunate time when I was working sales for a consumer facing speculative investments platform, I suddenly get a call from Maskyoo's founder & CEO, whom I had gotten to know pretty well over the years since working for him previously.

> "I've been developing a new product" he said "It's time to start thinking of go-to-market, you want the job?"

### The Company
[Maskyoo](http://www.maskyoo.com/) started out as a single founder operation back in 2010. Soon after, I had joined in to manage customer relations for nearly two years. By the time I came back for the role of Product Manager in 2014, the company had scaled ten-fold, both in terms of employees as well as revenue, to the point where they were the local-market leaders for providing Call-Tracking & IVR solutions, and in a position to expand both their product-line & target audience.

### The Work
I began working on the new brand e.g **static website, marketing videos, image & copywriting assets**, approaching the launch of the new product which, regrettably, ended up failing during proof of concept trials. Thus with no legs to stand on, the new brand was inevitably scrapped.

Around the same time Maskyoo had decided to expand and adapt it's call tracking product to new markets in the EU region, thus I began working on **redesigning the platform UX** using [Bootstrap Metronics](http://keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/) components, hiring and **managing a freelance frontend developer**, as well as assisting with term negogiations with suppliers in the region.
