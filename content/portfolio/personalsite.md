### The Story
Throughout my life I had been interested in technology, though I had always felt as if something was missing.. While I could hold my own during CS classes and exercises, when it came down to actual software development, I had never quite gotten the hang of things, especially when it came to web development.

So, while I'm not inclined on changing professions anytime soon, I still don't like being dependent on finding developers for side-projects either. Thus this is one of my first steps towards software development.

### The Work
This static website which was developed with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), is managed completely via [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) files.
Full documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/Yuvaldv/mySite-Hugo).
