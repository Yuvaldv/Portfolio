### The Story
One dreary October evening during an unfortunate time when I was working sales for a consumer facing speculative investments platform, I suddenly get a call from Maskyoo's founder, whom I had gotten to know pretty well over the years since working customer relations at his company.

> "I'm developing a new product" he says "It's time to start developing the go-to-market strategy, you want the job?"

### The Work
I started out by creating and developing the *brand website (WordPress), marketing videos, case studies, image & copywriting assets* for the new brand, Though through a run of bad luck the product eventually fell-through during technical proof of concept. So with no legs to stand on, the new brand was inevitably scrapped.

Just as this was happening, Maskyoo had decided to expand and adapt it's call tracking product to new markets in the EU region, thus I began *redesigning the platform UX* using [Bootstrap Metronics](http://keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/), hiring and *managing a freelance frontend developer from Upwork to develop the new version*, as well as *negotiating terms with VoIP SIP-trunk suppliers* in the new countries.

### The Company
[Maskyoo](http://www.maskyoo.com/) started out as a one-man operation back in 2010, soon after I had joined in to manage customer relations. By the time I came back for the role of Product Manager, the company had scaled ten-fold, both in terms of employees as well as revenue, to the point where they were a local leader for providing call-tracking solutions, and in a position to expand both their product-line & target audience.
