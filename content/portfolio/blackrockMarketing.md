Product Manager

### The Story
After leaving Maskyoo I began searching for a position which would allow me to acquaint myself with advanced analytics products such as [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/), [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) & [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/).

 A couple of weeks later I had found a new home for myself which offered all that and much, much more: Blackrock Marketing-- a consumer facing marketing firm specializing is speculative investment and gambling products.

### The Team
During my time at Blackrock I reported to the company CMO[^CMO]-- the very talented [<i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Noam Wohl](http://il.linkedin.com/in/noamwohl), and worked closely with an accomplished team of designers, developers, media buyers, project, content & sales managers.

### The Work

Prime Signals was developed for android and published within 8 weeks from initial development. We used [Invision](https://invisionapp.com), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) & [DaPulse](https://dapulse.com) for project & asset management; [GA](https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/), [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) & our own PHP-based admin-panel for analytics & product optimization as well as [AppAnnie](https://appannie.com) & [SimiliarWeb](https://similarweb.com) for market analysis and ASO[^ASO].

The app was essentially a marketing funnel aimed at generating low-CPA[^CPA], high-LTV[^LTV] leads from both organic and advertised mobile sources through speculative trading gamification.

#### Glenmore Capital
As I was onboarding into the company, our CTO[^CTO] was still struggling with finding a qualified android developer, thus my attention was directed towards a new brand that was being conceptualized at the time-- Glenmore Capital.
I ended up doing the copywriting, just over 2000 words, as well as managing specific features such as multi-language support and SaaS integrations for the new website.

#### IVR[^IVR] System
Another task that split my attention during that same time was reconfiguring the company's inbound telemarketing solutions i.e designing & implementing a new IVR[^IVR] flow to better attract & retain our customer base.

#### Funnels
During my time at Blackrock one of the constants was the perpetual requirement for new and engaging funnels to attract our customer base. Which, for me, entailed managing the deployment of landing pages beautifully designed by [<i class="fa fa-linkedin-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>Katya K](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katya-k-58b5b825), working on video content via Adobe [Premiere](http://www.adobe.com/il_en/products/premiere.html) & [AfterEffects](http://www.adobe.com/il_en/products/aftereffects.html) as well as doing market research mainly using [WhatRunsWhere](https://www.whatrunswhere.com)
